# ðŸš€ Henox Website - GitHub Deployment Guide

This guide will help you upload your modernized Henox Business Consultant website to GitHub and deploy it for free hosting.

## ðŸ“¦ What You Have

Your website package includes:
- âœ… Modern React/TypeScript application
- âœ… Responsive design for all devices
- âœ… SEO optimized with meta tags
- âœ… Interactive components and animations
- âœ… Contact forms and quote calculator
- âœ… Professional design and branding

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Upload to GitHub

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in
   - Click the "+" icon and select "New repository"
   - Name it: `henox-business-website`
   - Make it public (for free hosting)
   - Check "Add a README file"

2. **Upload your files**:
   - Click "uploading an existing file" 
   - Drag and drop ALL your website files
   - Or use GitHub Desktop/Git commands if you're familiar

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to repository Settings**:
   - Click the "Settings" tab in your repository
   - Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar

2. **Configure Pages**:
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "main" 
   - Folder: "/ (root)"
   - Click "Save"

3. **Wait for deployment**:
   - GitHub will provide your website URL
   - Usually: `https://yourusername.github.io/henox-business-website`
   - Initial deployment takes 5-10 minutes

### Step 3: Build and Deploy

Since your website is a React application, you need to build it first:

1. **Add build workflow** (GitHub Actions):
   Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
      
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./dist
```
